## Core Features
- User registration/authentication with role-based access
- ROPA record creation, editing, and approval workflow
- Custom field management for extended data collection
- Excel file import/export functionality
- Audit logging for compliance tracking
- Risk assessment and DPIA management

## User Roles
- **Privacy Officer**: Administrative access, can approve/reject records, manage users
- **Privacy Champion**: Can create and edit own department's ROPA records
